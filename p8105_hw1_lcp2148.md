# Problem 1.

Creating a data frame with:

-   random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

-   logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
    than 0

-   character vector of length 10

-   factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0), 
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_logical = ifelse(norm_samp > 0, print("Negative"), print("Not")),
  vec_factor = (c("low", "low", "low", "med", "med", "med", "med", "high", "high", "high")) 
)
```

    ## [1] "Negative"
    ## [1] "Not"

Trying to take mean of each variables in the dataframe.

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))

mean_char = mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_logic = mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_facto = mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

There are errors for the variables without numerical values, because you
cannot take the mean.

The mean for the random sample is
`mean_samp = mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))` = 0.128

Next, I’ll try to apply the as.numeric function to the variables which
couldn’t give a mean.

``` r
vec_char = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
vec_logical = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_logical))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
vec_factor = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

Running this code returns the “NAs introduced by coercion” warning,
because none of the variable values were equivalent to a numerical one.
This would make calculating the mean from these three variables
impossible.
