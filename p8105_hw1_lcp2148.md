# Problem 1.

Creating a data frame with:

-   random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

-   logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
    than 0

-   character vector of length 10

-   factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0), 
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_factor = (c("low", "low", "low", "med", "med", "med", "med", "high", "high", "high")) 
)
```

Trying to take mean of each variables in the dataframe.

``` r
mean_samp = mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))

mean_char = mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_logic = mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))

mean_facto = mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

There are errors for the variables without numerical values, because you
cannot take the mean.

The mean for the random sample is
`mean_samp = mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))`

The mean for the logical vector indicating whether elements of the
sample are greater than 0 `mean_logic = mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))`

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to
another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?
